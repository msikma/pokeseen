## PokéSeen

This is a small script that determines when each Pokémon was last seen in the TV show, and how many appearances each one has made. The statistics are generated from data on [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/) and the results are compiled into a single HTML file.

## Usage

To generate the page, run `npm run generate-page`. This will retrieve statistical data first and then generate the page. The page content will be saved to `/docs`.
